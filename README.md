ngAudioSprite
===================

The angular audio sprite has been designed around the format output used by the [audiosprite](https://github.com/tonistiigi/audiosprite) which generates audio sprites in multiple formats
as well as a JSON map of the sounds.

## Usage

### Configuration object

This is the format generated by `audiosprite` and supported by `ngAudioSprite`.
When loading a config file a base path will be generated based on the configuration file path which will be prefixed to the resource use.

```json
{
  "resources": [
    "sprite.ogg", 
    "sprite.m4a",
    "sprite.mp3",
    "sprite.ac3"
  ],
  "spritemap": {
    "sound1": {
      "start": 0,
      "end": 1.92,
      "loop": false
    },
    "sound2": {
      "start": 3,
      "end": 4.824013605442177,
      "loop": false
    }
}
```

### Loading a configuration file

From the service `audioSprite.load("sprite.json");`

From the directive `<audio ng-audio-sprite="sprite.json"></audio>`

### Setting the configuration file

Respect the same format as the configuration object but set the paths for resources as no request path will be available to generate them.

From the service `audioSprite.configure(config);`

From the directive `<audio ng-audio-sprite="sprite.json"></audio>`

Updating the directive attribute when used will trigger loading

### Playing a sound

To play a sound from the audio sprite simply call `play` on the service and pass it the sound key as found on the `spritemap` of the configuration object.

`audioSprite.play("sound1");`

### Stopping a sound

Simply call `stop` on the service

`audioSprite.stop();`

### Doing more from the directive

You can also still set yourself the sources for the audio and simply pass the sprite map via the `ng-audio-spritemap` attribute.
Attribute update will update the sprite map used.

```html

<audio ng-audio-sprite ng-audio-spritemap='{"sound1": { "start": 0, "end": 1.92, "loop": false }, "sound2": { "start": 3, "end": 4.824013605442177, "loop": false}}'>
    <source src="sprite.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
</audio>

```

## Running the demo

To run the demo simply clone this repo, install dependencies and run the web server. The demo will be available at `http://localhost:8000/app/`
 
```npm install``` to install dependencies

```npm start``` to start the web server

## Dev commands

```npm test``` to start unit testing suite (test run when app file is updated)

```npm run protractor``` to start end to end testing, the web server must be running and WebDriver installed using ```npm run update-webdriver```

```grunt``` to build the application from the source directory

```grunt watch``` to build the application when files are updated
